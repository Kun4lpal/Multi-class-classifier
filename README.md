Classification of Human Acitivity Dataset

HUMAN ACITIVTY DATASET - 
6 classes, 561 attribiutes and 7351 data points.
Implementation using Keras as well as a backprop network with only numpy as its dependency.

This is a research topic i am working on. Goal was to explore how assymetrical miss-classification cost can affect the
prediction of a neural network.
